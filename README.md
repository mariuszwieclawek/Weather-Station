# Weather-Station
Project based on Microchip ATmega328PB Xplained Mini Evaluation Kit. Building a simple "weather station" to measure basic parameters such as
temperature, humidity, light intensity and the occurrence of rainfall. The device will be based
on a microprocessor and sensors. Current data can be viewed using a smartphone
application using Bluetooth communication or using USB connection and computer software
like “putty”. Data can also be saved to non-volatile memory and read at a later date.
